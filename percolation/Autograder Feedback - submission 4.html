Testing correctness of Percolation
*-----------------------------------------------------------
Running 21 total tests.

Tests 1 through 7 create a Percolation object using your code, then repeatedly
open sites by calling open(). After each call to open(), it checks the return
values of isOpen(), percolates(), numberOfOpenSites(), and isFull() in that order.
Tests 12 through 15 create a Percolation object using your code, then repeatedly
call the methods open(), isOpen(), isFull(), percolates(), and, numberOfOpenSites()
in random order with probabilities p = (p1, p2, p3, p4, p5). The tests stop
immediately after the system percolates.

Tests 18 through 21 test backwash.

Except as noted, a site is opened at most once.

If one of the values in the table violates the performance limits
the factor by which you failed the test appears in parentheses.
For example, (9.6x) in the union() column indicates that it uses
9.6x too many calls.


Tests 2a-2f: Check whether the number of calls to union(), connected(), and find()
             is a constant per call to open(), isOpen(), isFull(), and percolates().
             The table shows the maximum number of union() and find() calls made
             during a single call to open(), isOpen(), isFull(), and percolates().
             One call to connected() counts as two calls to find().

                 n     per open()      per isOpen()    per isFull()    per percolates()

Running time (in seconds) depends on the machine on which the script runs.


Test 3: Create an n-by-n percolation system; interleave calls to percolates()
        and open() until the system percolates. The values of n go up by a
        factor of sqrt(2). The test is passed if n &gt;= 4096 in under 10 seconds.

     The approximate order-of-growth is n ^ (log ratio)
